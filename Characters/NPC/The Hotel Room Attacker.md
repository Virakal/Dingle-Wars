They are wearing all black with a skin tight bodysuit and black glass mask covering their entire face. They appear female but they have a robotic, modulated voice that seems androgynous. They use an electrostaff.

They attacked us in [Gumala Adeen](Gumala%20Adeen.md)'s penthouse suite at the [Starlight Hotel](../../Places/Infinity%20Station/Starlight%20Hotel.md).

They are after [The Lightsaber](../../Plot/The%20Lightsaber.md) and mentioned that they will get paid for retrieving it. They have security footage of the party (other than [Prashap](../PCs/Prashap.md)) looting the wreckage of the [Lady Finger](../../Plot/Lady%20Finger.md).
