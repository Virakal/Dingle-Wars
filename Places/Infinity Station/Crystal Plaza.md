A gambling/casino area. Basically a huge Vegas type place. Everything is gold metal and neon signs.

One main thoroughfare with stairs leading up to the [Infinity Dome](Infinity%20Dome.md). Terraces with gambling areas like slots, etc. Lots of protocol droids as hostesses bringing drinks and things around.

Security on the plaza is handled by the Rancor group.
