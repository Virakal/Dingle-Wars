**Note**: Top-right spaceport is actually the [Starlight Hotel](Starlight%20Hotel.md).
## Description
The station is owned and built by the [Quasar Investment Group](../../Factions%20and%20Groups/Quasar%20Investment%20Group.md).

It's a ring shaped structure attached to a central column with spokes. The top half of the ring is made of transparent glass.

The station rotates every 30 hours, which is how it maintains its artificial gravity. Between hours 20 and 30 there is an artificial night where all lights are turned off.
## Security
The station has private security rather than the usual storm troopers; There is very little imperial presence in general. Security checks seem to be nominal and people are allowed to roam the station with their weapons.

There seem to be four separate security groups:
- Market security
- Dome security
- Droid security
- (TODO: Missed one)
