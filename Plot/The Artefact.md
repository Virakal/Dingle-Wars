![[Saber Hilt.png]]
An allegedly ancient Jedi artefact.

The artefact is stored in a briefcase belonging to [Gumala Adeen](../Characters/NPC/Gumala%20Adeen.md). We managed to open the briefcase in [Session 1](../Session/Session%201.md) and discovered it's a silver hilted lightsaber. The saber has a brown blade.

[Luca](../Characters/PCs/Luca.md) seems to have some connection to it - he had a feeling in his chest when he saw it. [Vyna](../Characters/PCs/Vyna.md) noticed that Luca notices something.
